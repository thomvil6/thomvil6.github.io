Currently working as an assistant professor in the Energy Department at [Ã‰cole Mines-Nancy](https://mines-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/), my teaching activities mainly concern transport phenomena (heat, mass, electrical carriers, ...), radiative transfers, numerical methods and statistics. I also supervise several second and third-year student projects: integration of photovoltaic panels on a building roof and modeling of energy requirements, proposals for innovative solutions in an urban environment to improve thermal comfort in the presence of a heat island, experimental measurements and simulations of the apparent emissivity of rectangular cavities for industrial projects, eco-design of a bicycle, etc.

On the research side, I am working at the [LEMTA laboratory](https://lemta.univ-lorraine.fr/) in the "Heat Management" team. I am interested in the use of solar resources, particularly photovoltaic processes, heat management and building thermics, and more generally in aspects of thermal comfort in urban environments. I still work closely with [Cerema](https://www.cerema.fr/fr) on urban heat island issues and urban greening solutions.

My expertise lies in the modeling and simulation of coupled heat and mass transfers for a wide range of applications. You can find more details about my curriculum [here](/cv/) and about my research work in [publications](/publications/). I regularly update this site with articles on a few scientific subjects of interest, either dealing with purely technical aspects (IT), or directly linked to societal issues.
